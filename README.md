!!!NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO COPY OR USE MY CODE WITHOUT MY WRITTEN PREMISSION!!!
This jupyter notebook is my final project in my Intro to Machine Learning course.
In the project we received home mortgage data with multiple varying features and label. Each row in the data was an mortgage application and the label was whether the application was approved or not.
I needed to explore the data for patterens, preprocess the data, model the data and evaluate my models' preformances.
The PDF file is the written project explaining various conclusions and actions made during the making of this project.
